# Hi 👋, I'm Moses!

I have been developing solutions for 6 years as a FULL STACK in large companies in the technology field.

- 👩‍💻 I develop in PHP, Laravel, Javascript, React and Native, Vue.js and Node.js.

- 🌱 Adopting best programming practices like Clean Code, Test, DDD among others.

- 🤝 I'm always looking to learn and help people, so I spend my free time creating content for IG and posting for Medium, but only as a beginner lol'.

### 🚨 Atencion
It's been a while since I've updated Github for reasons of giving preference to Gitlab, I recommend that you take a look at the profile over at Gitlab...
